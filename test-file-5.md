# [Task 1]: This isn't a link (ps. this is meant to break the code)

[actual link](hello_there.com)

Also doesn't work if there are brackets[] and followed by parenthesis. This (will) extract unintended strings.

[another link](find_this.com)

Below is supposed to show a downloaded image, not a useable link:
![image of something](desktop/folder/image.png)

There are only two valid links to extract.
